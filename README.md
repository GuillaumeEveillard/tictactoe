# tictactoe


## Purpose

This is a small web game developped in Clojurescript.

The purpose of this project is to teach functional programming and by incrementally creating a small game.

Clojurescript stroke me as an awesome language to do it: the integration to the browser makes the feed-back loop really entertaining.


## More information

The game is hosted by GitHub pages at:
